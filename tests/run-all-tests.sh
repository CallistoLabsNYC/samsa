# Usage: ./run-all-tests <Kafka versions separated by ':'>...
#
# This script will automatically set up the Docker environment for Kafka, and then
# run all cargo tests, including integration tests, for each Kafka version specified.
# For example, running:
#
# ./run-all-tests 0.8.2.2:0.9.0.0
#
# will run the tests against Kafka versions 0.8.2.2 and 0.9.0.0. The arguments
# should correspond to a Docker tag of the `wurstmeister/kafka` image, so any valid
# tag will doâ€”i.e.,
#
# ./run-all-tests latest
#
# will run against the most recent Kafka version published in the
# `wurstmeister/kafka` repo. If there are no versions specified, it runs the tests
# on a set of default versions.
